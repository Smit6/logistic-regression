# Logistic Regression
Implements Logistic Regression (using sigmoid), Multinomial Logistic Regression (using softmax) and Polynomial Logistic Regression.

## Dataset

- make_regression data from sklearn.datasets
- Iris dataset

## Logistic Regression (Sigmoid)
### sklearn
Leverages sklearn Logistic Regression algorithm to separate two clusters by drawing the line.

### scratch
Implemetation of logistic regression algorithm from sctrach to sperate two classes by drawing the line

### comparision
Draws the line to separate two clusters leveraging sklearn and scratch models on the same plot to compare the performace of logistic regression model built from scratch.


## Softmax Logistic Regression
### sklearn
Leverage sklearn Logistic Regression algorithm to predict species from sepal length and petal length.
